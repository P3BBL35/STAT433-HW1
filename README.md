1.  How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are
    missing? What might these rows represent?

``` r
flights %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_time))
```

Here we can see that 8,255 flights are missing a `dep_time` value. Other
missing variables include `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, `arr_delay`, and
`air_time`. These rows may represent any flights that were canceled.

2.  Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at,
    but hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous
    numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number
    of minutes since midnight.

``` r
flights %>%
  mutate(dep_time = ((dep_time %/% 100) * 60) + dep_time %% 100,
         sched_dep_time = ((sched_dep_time %/% 100) * 60) + sched_dep_time %% 100)
```

3.  Look at the number of canceled flights per day. Is there a pattern?
    Is the proportion of canceled flights related to the average delay?
    Use multiple `dyplr` operations, all on one line, concluding with
    `ggplot(aes(x= ,y=)) + geom_point()`

``` r
flights %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(average_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T),
            total_flights = n(),
            canceled_flights = sum(is.na(dep_delay)),
            proportion_canceled = canceled_flights / total_flights) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = average_delay, y = proportion_canceled)) + geom_point()
```

There seems to be a positive correlation between the `average_delay` and
`proportion_cancelled`. That is, the larger the departure delay, the
more likely it is that the flight is cancelled altogether.
